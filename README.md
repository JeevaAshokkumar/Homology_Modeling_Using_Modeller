## Introduction
Homology modeling, also known as comparative modeling, is a computational technique used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on the known structures of homologous proteins (templates). This README provides a step-by-step guide to model the NS3 protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 3, a variant reported from Pakistan, using the Modeller software.

The NS3 protease is an essential enzyme for the replication of HCV and a target for antiviral drugs. Understanding its structure can aid in the design of new therapeutic agents.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:
- [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/) (version 10.1 or later)
- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Biopython (for sequence handling)
- A text editor (for preparing input files)
- An internet connection (for template retrieval)

## Installation
### Modeller
1. Download Modeller from the official website: [Modeller Download](https://salilab.org/modeller/download_installation.html)
2. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
3. Obtain a license key by registering on the Modeller website.

### Python and Biopython
1. Install Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Biopython using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install biopython
   ```

## Methodology
The homology modeling process consists of several steps:

1. **Sequence Retrieval**: Obtain the amino acid sequence of the NS3 protease of HCV Genotype 3 from a sequence database like NCBI.
2. **Template Identification**: Use BLAST to find homologous protein structures in the PDB database.
3. **Alignment**: Align the query sequence with the template sequences.
4. **Model Building**: Use Modeller to build the 3D structure based on the alignment.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the generated model using various validation tools.

## Running the Homology Modeling
### Step 1: Sequence Retrieval
Save the NS3 protease sequence in a FASTA format file, e.g., `ns3_sequence.fasta`.

### Step 2: Template Identification
Run BLAST to find suitable templates:
```sh
blastp -query ns3_sequence.fasta -db pdb -out blast_results.txt
```
Select the best templates based on sequence identity and coverage.

### Step 3: Alignment
Prepare an alignment file (`alignment.ali`) including the target and template sequences. Use tools like Clustal Omega or the alignment function in Modeller.

### Step 4: Model Building
Create the following script files for Modeller:

#### Script1.py
Refer to `Script1.py`.

#### Script2.py
Refer to `Script2.py`.

Run the scripts:

First, run `Script1.py`:
```sh
mod9.25 Script1.py
```

Then, run `Script2.py`:
```sh
mod9.25 Script2.py
```

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the generated models using tools such as:
- **DOPE score**: Available in Modeller
- **Ramachandran plot**: Use tools like PROCHECK
- **Verify 3D**: Check the compatibility of the 3D model with its own amino acid sequence using tools like Verify3D

## Results
The resulting models will be in the output directory specified in the script. Assess the best model based on the evaluation criteria mentioned above.

## Conclusion
Homology modeling of the NS3 protease of HCV Genotype 3 can provide valuable insights into its structure and function. This model can be used for further studies on drug binding and enzyme activity, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for Hepatitis C.
